# Overview

This is an exploratory project getting used to using youtube to post videos, and Github to publish content.

The current project is a simple barbones hello world program written in python.

I decided to persue this project as a way to become comfortable with publishing content.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to write the program, Github to publish, and youtube to record the tech demo

The code was written using Python. Python is a basic object orientated programing language that is simple to use and impliment. It is often used for people new to coding, but has advanced applications such as deep learning in AI development.
